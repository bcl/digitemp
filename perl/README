Digitemp v2.6
Copyright 1996-2002 by Brian C. Lane <bcl@brianlane.com>


Here are a few useful perl scripts for you to use with DigiTemp. Most of
them need customization for your specific circumstances. Some these scripts
are old, as I now use the RRD tool to graph and log data.

The digitemp_sql.pl script is new, and has not been tested extensivly yet,
but should work for users familiar with the MySQL database system.


inc_temp	Build a file suitable for including into a server side
		include webpage (or modify it to create the whole webpage.
		This script operates on a logfile output from digitemp when
		running with the -l option.

rem_temp	Create an include file as in inc_temp and then send it to
		a server via FTP.
		This script operates on a logfile output from digitemp when
		running with the -l option.

maxplot		Create a GIF image of the temperature graph.
		This script operates on a logfile output from digitemp when
		running with the -l option.

check_digitemp.pl
		This is a NetSaint/Nagios (www.nagios.com) script that uses
		DigiTemp to check temperatures on monitored machines.

digitemp_sql.pl	MySQL database logging of temperatures.

		This is a new script, it logs the serial number and temperature
		in Fahrenheit to a MySQL database. I assume that you are
		familiar with the care and feeding of your database so that I
		can skip over the simple stuff and get to the point:

		Create a new database named digitemp:
		mysqladmin create digitemp -u root -p

		Edit the grant_mysql.sql file and change the password and
		optionally the username. Grant access to the new database:

		mysql mysql -u root -p < mysql_grant.sql

		Create the database table:

		mysql digitemp -u root -p < make_mysql.sql

		Edit the digitemp_mysql.pl script. Change the password to the
		one you used above, optionally change the username.
		Point the digitemp_rcfile variable to the DigiTemp config file
		that you have previously created using digitemp -i -c rcfile

		I recommend using one other than .digitemprc so that it isn't
		accidently erased when you run digitemp -i from your home
		directory.

		Make sure the path to the digitemp binary is correct. It is
		specified by the $digitemp_binary variable.

		Setup a cron job to log temperatures to the database at
		regular intervals:

		*/5 * * * *   /home/brian/bin/digitemp_mysql.pl

		At this time I have not written any logging or graphing
		scripts to deal with the MySQL temperature data.
