01/01/2007      Released v3.5.0

12/26/2006      Adding DS1923 Hygrosens Logger support from Tomasz Nowak
                Moved all of the history to ChangeLog

12/25/2006      Added Cygwin support
                Fixing ambiguous error messages (eg. blank config file
                or blank serial device).

06/25/2005      Logging output for DS2438 is not consistent with the other
                outputs. When -o2 and -o3 are used the temperatures for the
                DS2438 devices are output.
                The -H option can still be used to customize the DS2438
                output when not using the -o options.

02/03/2004      Broke DS9097 support with my owWriteBytePower() return code
                check in digitemp.c in v3.3.1, so I applied the new DS9097
                performance patch from Erik Rigtorp and changed owLevel in 
                the ds9097 code to return the value called with to fake out
                the higher level code.

                Added FREEBSD to the typedef section of ownet.h, maybe this
                will fix some of those problems.

02/01/2004      Fixed DS2490 USB adapter support. Fixed Makefile so that it 
                doesn't need to be edited for USB support.

01/25/2004      A user reported a bug in the humidity temperature, it
                wasn't converting negative temperatures correctly.
                I also see a potential problem with the DS18B20 and DS1822
		which use a short int type and depend on it being 16 bits
		so that the sign comes out correct. But can we count on a
		short int always being 16 bits? I need to look into it.

01/10/2004	I'm trying to wrap up all the patches I've received int a new
		release v3.3.0 with humidity and DS2438 support. Added code
		from Eric Wilde to do humidity calculations for the 
		AAG TAI-8540 humidity sensor.
		
		Adding patches for OpenBSD from Måns Nilsson.
		
		Changing the binary names that are generated to differentiate
		between DS9097, DS9097U and DS2490 (usb) adapter support.
		
		The USB support still doesn't work right. It searches the LAN
		ok, but needs to be root to do so, and doesn't read properly.
		I'll deal with it in the next release I guess.
		
		Added lockfiles. This requires either setting the binary to
		group lock (chmod g+s;chown .lock digitemp_*) or adding the
		user who will be running it to the lock group.

11/29/2003      Trying to get a first pass at DS2438 (A/D & Battery monitor)
                support up and running.
                Found a bug, init wouldn't record counters found on branches
		of a hub.

10/27/2003      Added patch from Sven Geggus to allow -n0 to make it run
                in an infinite loop. Need to check for exit conditions
   		and clean up logfile, serial port, etc. in a nice manner.

08/13/2003      Adding DS2490 USB to 1-wire adapter support. Bumping the
                version number to 3.3.0 without a release of 3.2.1

06/14/2003      Made change to hub search from Jesús Roncero, it wouldn't
                work right if run with -q (a owFirst was inside the
                quiet check). Also adding the manpage created by Jesú.

                Version changed to 3.2.1

05/24/2003      Adding a banner that reports what library the binary was
                compiled for (DS9097 or DS9097U).
                Adjusted the makefile a bit, change the dist to be one of
                dist-9097 or dist-9097u to build for the right target.

05/23/2003      Adding kludges for USB to Serial adapter. Added a loop of
                10 tries to the DS2480Detect routine. Added DEBUG_USERIAL
                compile time wrappers for diagnostic information about the
                ReadCOM routine. Part of the key to this is the delay used
                in ReadCOM, its just too short for use with the USB to
                serial adapter. I've changed it to 1 second + 10-15mS --
                I'm not sure that the global_msec is really needed with the
                longer timeout time, its a fail-safe anyway; the character
                ought to come back a long time before the timeout.

                Changed version to v3.2.0
                
02/14/2003      Adding logging of read values. Need to change the way it
                handles building the output string.
                It works, but the counter really needs its own format
                string. Kinda hard to automatically integrate it into the
                current temperature oriented format string.

02/12/2003      Adding more code... Needs more work, the family code may
                be buried in the coupler linked list. I may need to move the
                decision as to how to read it to after it finds the coupler
                and turns it on.
                Change read_temp to read_sensor. device selection is common
                to all devices, then switch based on the serial number
                finally selected (saved as it is selected).

02/06/2003      Changed version number to v3.1.0
                Adding support for counters
                Happy 92nd Birthday to Ronald Reagan!

01/10/2003      Finally, humidity is working, thanks in large part to work
                by Eric Wilde. Need to add logging of DS2438. I think it
                will be hard-coded, if it needs to be in another format
		it can be parsed with perl or python or whatever.
		Fixed a bug that wasn't allowing %% to be embedded in the
		format specifier.

		Adding lockfile support using the lockdev library under
		Linux. Wrapping it in LINUX checks until other systems
		indicate that they can use it.

		Lockfiles are working, but - the binary has to be sgid to
		the lock group so that it can access /var/lock, adding
		the user to the lock group would also accomplish this.

01/08/2003      Still trying to get DS2438 and Humidity support working
                Also changing strcpy to strncpy, dunno why they weren't
                already using it.

01/04/2003      Adding DS2438 based humidity support from Eric Wilde.

11/21/2002      Changed sleep method to use less CPU cycles, thanks to
                peter enderborg for pointing it out.

11/19/2002	Reviewing massive changes from Erik Rigtorp, he has added a
		userial compatible version of the passive adapter code. I am
		creating a new Makefile that will work for all systems and
		allow selection of the adapter at build time.

		Thanks for this version go to Erik Rigtorp for adding the
		userial compatible passive code. His webpage can be found
		at http://erkki.g0ds.org/

		Thanks also go out to Kevin Pedigo for his help in getting
		the new Makefile up and running. Kevin is the current
		President of KPLUG (www.kplug.org/~kevinp)

		Improved the sleep method when reading sensors multiple
		times so that it doesn't use 100 CPU while waiting. Thanks
		to peter enderborg for pointing this out.

		Changed version # to v3.0.0

08/21/2002      Small bug with -i crept in, it wants another command to be
                present, it won't just initalize.

08/18/2002	Added %N token to allow the time in seconds since Epoch to
		be selected in the output.
		Added module for NetSaint/Nagios to perl directory, it is
		named check_digitemp.pl
		Added a MySQL logging script to perl directory, it is named
		digitemp_mysql.pl
		Added check for serial port permissions and nice error
		output if the user doesn't have +rw on the selected port.
		Removed limitation on -i being the only command. It can be
		combined with other commands again.

		Changed to v2.6

08/16/2002      Adding %N token to output seconds since Epoch, which is
                masked by my use of %s for the sensor number. I don't want
                to remove %s, because that would break old code. So %N
		now maps to %s in the strftime format.
		The check for commands is too strict, it isn't allowing
		-i to be combined with any of the other commands.
		Added permission checking on the serial device with a clean
		exit if the user doesn't have access to the serial device.

06/23/2002      Releasing new version today. Really! Making -q turn off 
                the extra output I added for initalizing the 1-wire lan.

06/08/2002      Adding patches from John. exit() codes are now #defines
                and .digitemprc now outputs the serial numbers as hex
                instead of decimal. But maintains backwards compatibility
                until a new .digitemprc is written.
                Output format string now includes an option to output the
                Sensor's serial number in hex (%R).

06/08/2002      Made changes suggested by John Stoffel. Consisting mostly of
                code reorganizations.
                The one new feature is the %R format specifier for the log
                output string which inserts the hex serial number of the
                sensor into the output.
                We changed the way command line arguments are processed,
                so getopt is only called once, and added a check to make
                sure only 1 of the action commands is specified and complain
                otherwise.

                Changed to v2.5

05/11/2002      Adding more changes from John Stoffel

05/08/2002      Integrating changes for Solaris, AIX, FreeBSD from John
                Stoffel. Changes to getopt initial settings, Makefile
                and include files.

05/06/2002      Adding changes and fixes from DT v2.5 for Windows. 
                Family code for DS1822 was wrong, it is really 0x22
                Lots of changes to the read_temp routine, added a better
                scratchpad dump routine (previous one only worked for
                the DS1820).                
                Quite a bit needs to be changed, I have switched to using
		a structure to store the sensor and coupler lists. I
	        updated the core temperature read routine, the lan walk
                and device search routines. Reading when using a hub
                is now faster when reading multiple devices on the
                same hub segment.

01/15/2002      Cleaning up, preparing for release

01/15/2002      Added support for DS2409 one-wire couplers like those used in
                Simon Atkin's hub. www.simat.enta.net
		Converted to Dallas Semi's userial v3.00 one-wire library.
		Version changed to v2.3
		Added a -w command to walk the entire one-wire LAN and show all
		device serial numbers with a descriptive family type.
		Thanks to Ted Frohling for the loan of the one-wire Hub.

01/14/2002      Adding support for reading sensors on DS2409 couplers.

01/13/2002      Walking the tree now works -- after changing the swt1f.c
                routine to use the Smart-On Main command while searching
		for devices (otherwise it only finds the first).
		
		Adding support for Coupler to the main program.
		Init now works, writing .digitemprc now works.
		Read .digitemprc appears to work.
		Need to add reading of specified sensors and of all
		sensors.

01/12/2002      Adding a diagnostic walk of the attached network, working
                on DS2409 MicroLAN Coupler support.
		Added release1WireNet calls before all exit calls.
                Switching to the userial library v3.0.0, I seem to have
		run into a problem with the old library and I cannot read
		either of my DS9097U adapters with v2.2 digitemp code.

05/26/2001	The 18B20 and 1822 patch didn't work. It was reading the
   		wrong scratchpad registers. (2,1 instead of 1,0).
		Changed version to v2.2

03/16/2001	Integrating the AIX patch from Ewan Leith
   		<ejl@man.fraser-williams.com>
		It amounts to return value checking on getopt and changes
		in the wirelnk.c file.
		Adding DS1822 and DS18B20 changes from Roland Roberts
		<roland@astrofoto.org>

03/16/2001	Integrated the AIX changes
		Integrated the DS1822 and DS18B20 patch
		Added the patch for DS1822 and DS18B20 support.

03/13/2001	Version 2.1 release
		Added detection of a temperature glitch in the DS1820
		Added detection of the DS18S20's 85 degree C error state
		Added output of error conditions to stderr
		Bad reads will now insert zeros instead of skipping the sensor
		If a read fails it is retried 3 times before giving up on that
		sensor. The remainder of the sensors are still attempted.
		Added a command line option (-c) to allow the configuration
		file to be specified.
		Added a couple more scripts to the rrdb directory.


03/05/2001	Adding a command line option to specify the configuration
   		file to use. -c config_file will override the default of
   		.digitemprc

02/17/2001	If there is an error with strong pullup on/off it shouldn't
   		abort the conversion! Just log an error to stderr.

01/31/2001	Added a dummy temperature output when a sensor cannot be
   		read. It outputs a 0 so that scripts like my grapher 
   		don't get confused and log the wrong sensor in the wrong
   		place.
   		
   		An error message is also output to stderr.

01/29/2001	Oops. It seems that I missed the line in the DS1820 
   		datasheet that says Vdd needs to be tied to GND for
   		Parasite power to work correctly.
   		Various curses come to mind.
   		The DS1820 works better than the DS18S20 with Vdd floating
   		but this probably explains the infrequent glitches I
   		saw before adding the DS18S20s.

01/15/2001	Still getting glitches.
   		Adding a reset and delay before retry

01/14/2001      Changed Version number to 2.1
   
   		I now have 2 DS18S20 sensors which supposedly fix the
  		Temperature accuracy problems of the DS1820 (see the
  		ds1820-report.pdf from Dallas). But now I get a huge
  		number of glitches in the DS18S20's readings.
  		The DS18S20 has an error condition, but it is +85C and
  		the glitches I am seeing are because DigiTemp doesn't
  		output anything at all for the DS18S20's reading.
  		
  		Adding a check for the DS18S20's error condition:
  		LSB = 0xAA
  		MSB = 0x00
  		COUNT_REMAIN = 0x0C
  		COUNT_PER_C = 0x10
  		
  		If this error case is encountered, the reading should be
  		repeated. If it comes up again, use it.
  		
  		There is also a glitch possible in the DS1820 that exhibits
  		itself by COUNT_PER_C - COUNT_REMAIN = 1, this should be
  		checked for, and the reading repeated and the next result
  		used.

		The problem with no reading from the device seems to
		happen when MLanAccess is called. There is no good way to
		tell what the problem is, so I will change the code to
		try 3 times before failing. Changes are in read_temp.
						
01/04/2000      Changing the default read timeout to 1000mS. I had problems
                with it set to 500mS and a 30' sensor wire (the reading
                was low by about 10 degrees).

01/04/2000      Version 2.0 release
                Adding support for the DS9097-U adapter for the Linux
                version. The Solaris version will need changes to be able
                to support the DS9097-U.
                Changed license to GNU Public License v2.0
                Added the -q option to make the banner disappear.

01/01/2000      Well, no release last year. Adding -q to make the banner
                dissapear for batchfiles that want to get the output
                directly.

12/28/1999      Changed Version number to 2.0
                Adding GNU public license
                Changing this code to use the DS9097-U adapter

06/03/1999      Finishing this thing up.

06/02/1999      Use 2 logging routines, log_time to log a single line
                per sensor with optional time data and log_str to log
                a single line for multiple sensors with elapsed time at
                the beginning of the line.

05/29/1999      Added 2 new init file tags, LOG_FORMAT and LOG_TYPE
                New formatting works, need to clean up the logic now.
		
05/27/1999      Adding user specified format string. To use it, first
                parse out the digitemp specific stuff and create a new
                string to feed into strftime, with the sensor, temperature
                already set.

05/24/1999      Adding a output specifier string, this will allow users
                to configure the output to look however they want it to.
                The format string uses strftime tokens plus 3 special
                ones for digitemp - %s for sensor #, %C for centigrade,
                %F for fahrenheit

05/23/1999      Adding Solaris support via -DSOLARIS define
                Fixing the time problems once and for all, using localtime
                in the log_line routine. The user should have TZ set
                correctly for their timezone. This has been tested
                and works correctly.

                Changed version number to v1.3

05/23/1999      Adding Solaris changes, donated by a user.
                Removing libc5 binaries, I no longer have a libc5 system
                Fixing the time problems with logging

01/14/1999      A user in Sweden (and another in Finland) discovered a
                long standing bug. In do_temp I should have been using
                0x100 instead of 0xFF for the subtraction. This caused
                temperatures below 0 degrees C to jump up 1 degree as
                it decreased. This is fixed.
   		
                Changed version number to v1.2

10/20/1998      Adding new features from DOS version to keep things
                consistent. Removing the debug command, not used anyway.
                Added a free() to error condition edit from read_rcfile()

                Set some cases of freeing to = NULL, also freed the rom
                list before doing a search rom (searchROM checks too, but
                this is the right place for it).

08/31/1998      Adding a check for family 0x10 so that we can read DS1820s
                while they are on a network that includes other 1-wire
                devices.
                Fixed a problem with freeing uninitalized rom_list when
                starting a SearchROM. Not sure why this never appeared
                before.

03/06/1998      Adding a -d debug level to help figure out why this thing
                is no longer working.

03/13/1997      Error in CRC calculation. Wrong # of bytes.
                Error with 3 sensors. Sometimes doesn't store correct ROM
                data to .digitemprc -- need to malloc more memory dummy!

03/08/1997      Adding user defined timeouts for failure and for the
                read delay.

01/24/1997      Changed over to correct baud rate and 6 bits @ 115.2k
                ROM search function is now working. All low level code
                is functioning except for Alarm Search. Starting to move
                into a seperate object file with API for users to write
                their own code with.
   		
01/22/97        Working on ROM search routine, double cannot handle a full
                64 bits for some reason, converting to 64 byte array for
                each bit.

01/19/1997      Rewriting for new interface. This programs handles all the
                low level communications with the temperature sensor using
                the 115200k serial adapter.
   
01/02/1996      Rewriting this code to be more user friendly
