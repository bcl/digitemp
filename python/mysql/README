This script is pretty rough at the moment. I haven't made any attempt to
clean it up and make it more user friendly yet. But it does work if you're
willing to take the time to tweak it. It reads temps, logs them to a MySQL
database named weather as a user named weather, logs the data to a RRD and
writes a new sigfile.

Requirements are:
  DigiTemp v3.1.x+       http://www.digitemp.com
  MySQL database         http://www.mysql.org
  Round Robin Database   http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/
  Python MySQLdb module  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-python.html

If you find any problems, let me know. I may have forgotten something.

The windspeed calculation isn't correct. I'm still working on graphs that
are based on the MySQL database data.
