X 0. Get USB adapter running using libusb and PDK.
     Still need to run as root, but it is working.

X a. Review changes and test code from Erik Rigtorp

  b. Reduce cpu usage in the loop when doing multiple conversions

X c. Add infinite loop

  d. Catch TERM to exit the loop cleanly

  e. review emails and make any other needed changes

  1. Add global variables for the slew rate and re/write timing adjustments
     in the ds2840ut.c file. Add control of these to the digitemp.c code.

X 2. Add support for rpm building

X 4. check for permission to open the serial device and complain when it
     fails.

X 6. Write some SQL based scripts. Perl to feed the database with the output
     and PHP scripts to graph it using gd or ? modules in PHP.

X 7. Change the sensor token so it doesnt conflict with ctime. change small s
     to capital S.

X 8. Loosen up checks for commands so -i -a will work!! -i should be allowed
     with all others.

X 9. Create a lockfile for the serial port in use, and check the lock file
     before opening it.

 10. Fix problems using the USB serial port. Not sure what's happening. It
     will sometimes work, most of the time fail. Extending VTIME didn't make
     any noticable difference.

     I changed global_msec_max (controls the time delay for characters in
     the ReadCOM routine). It might be a slight improvement, but still fails
     a considerable percentage of the time.

     Sometimes the DS2480 detection fails, sometimes the search fails. It
     will also sometimes run fine (and quickly).

     Getting somewhere:

     Fails: 17 45 5B 0F 91

     Works: 16 44 5A 00 93

     Sent : 17 45 5B 0F 91

     Once : C1 17 45 5B 0F

     I added a wrapper for DS2480Detect that retries up to 10 times before
     giving up.

     Extending the maximum time to 1.800 or so (1sec + 800mS) also helps it
     run better. Without that it doesn't read the data very well. Without
     the loop on DS2480Detect it doesn't work consistently with the dongle.

     I need to add the delays back in, and see how they effect normal
     operation. 



X11. Add counter and switch support.
     Counter support has been added. DS2406 counters.

 12. Add long-argument switches to the program so that counter and switch
     results can be turned on/off. Temperature as well.

 13. Update and review all documents and directions to make sure they are
     current and match the command line.

X14. Fix the Makefile so that it doesn't need to be edited for different
     targets (ie. the ds2490)

X15. Need to update the digitemp.1 manpage.
