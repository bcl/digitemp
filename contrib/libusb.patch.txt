I've successfully used the driver found in main PDK archive 
(owpd300b2.zip) under generic library using usblnk.c and usbses.lnk. 
This driver in turn uses libusb library found on the internet.

I've found libusb v0.1.7, which contained a small bug in linux.c file. 
The fixed routine is below.

int usb_bulk_read(usb_dev_handle *dev, int ep, char *bytes, int size,
    int timeout)
{
  struct usb_bulktransfer bulk;
  int ret, retrieved = 0, requested;

  /* Ensure the endpoint address is correct */
  ep |= USB_ENDPOINT_IN;

  do {
    bulk.ep = ep;
    requested = size - retrieved;
    if (requested > MAX_READ_WRITE)
      requested = MAX_READ_WRITE;
    bulk.len = requested;
    bulk.timeout = timeout;
    bulk.data = (unsigned char *)bytes + retrieved;

    ret = ioctl(dev->fd, IOCTL_USB_BULK, &bulk);
    if (ret < 0)
      USB_ERROR_STR(ret, "error reading from bulk endpoint 0x%x: %s",
    ep, strerror(errno));

    retrieved += ret;
  } while (ret > 0 && retrieved < size); /* Yefim: && ret == requested */

  return retrieved;
}

Best regards,

Mike.
