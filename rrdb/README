  The Round Robin Database is a great way to store data that you want to
  graph. You can get it from:
    http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

  log_temps calls digitemp and adds the current temperature readings to the
  RRD database. It should be called from a crontab at regular intervals.

  log-temperature.pl is a Perl script that runs digitemp and inserts the
  new samples into the RRDB, optionally it can create a text file for use
  in an email signature.

  make_temps creates a RRD database suitable for logging 3 sensors of data.

  temp-all.cgi
  temp-one.cgi are scripts to generate .png graphs of temperature data.
  Insert them into your webpage with: <IMG SRC="temp-all.cgi">

  temp-minmax.cgi generates a graph with minimum and maximum printed on the
  graph.

  The suggested initialization sets up digitemp to output the temperature in
  Centigrade and the conversion to Fahrenheit. The -o option passed to
  digitemp when it is initalized controls how the temperature is output.
